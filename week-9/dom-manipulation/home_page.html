<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- What did you learn about DOM?
I learned that DOM is the way HTML and CSS are manipulated on your web browser. The first part always requires selecting the correct HTML and then using built-in methods/functions to manipulate them.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
There are plenty and it depends on what you want to do. I would it is very useful to be comfortable with DOM properties and Methods. If you do not have the correct element selected you will not be able to do any of the fun style objects like columnFill or resize. -->
