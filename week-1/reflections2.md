# Think About Time
Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I learned about setting accomplishable goals and time constraints in order to be productive. The videos and articles had a common theme of setting time constraints of when to be productive and focused and setting time aside for mental breaks.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time boxing is directly setting up time blocks of when to do "work" and allotting time for a "break". The time to do work is long enough that you can stay alert and focused without being distracted. This time ranges from 25-50 minutes, depending on the topic, the person, and the alertness level. After the time block for "work" is over you go into a "break", consisting of 10-20 minutes. The break lets us reset your brain for another box of "work".

How do you manage your time currently?
I have been using time boxing since I was in college. This the overall idea is not new to me, however it was nice to dive into some research to help hone my skills at time boxing. Depending on the topic and how I feel, I will look at the clock and say to myself, "I will work to 12:30 without any distractions". When 12:30 hits I will finish my last thought or go on for a few more minutes if I am really into what I am doing, then I will go into a break. The break lasts from 10-20 minutes. Then I repeat the process. I can do about three "pomodoros" (conisting of 40 minutes to an hour, with 10-20 minute breaks) before a long sustained break such a lunch, exercise, or a nap.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
Yes, I have been successful doing this since junior year of college. I was real crappy student until my last few years at Kent State. When I started to hit the books, I looked for studying strategies and fine tuned my time management.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
By myself, it's pretty easy. I've been blessed with an ability to shut out distractions, get to work, and accomplish daily tasks. With a team I am interested to see this dynamic in action. I think there needs to be ground rules and discussions of how we would work in a team beforehand.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
It's funny, I already had my plan of action before DBC even asked me. I think the military has taught me well when it comes to operating on a daily basis and future planning. I plan to wake up at 7, walk my dog, work Phase 0 until about 10-11, work a bike courier lunch shift, do DBC/chores in the afternoon, then do another bike courier dinner shift or more DBC if necessary. Then call it a day.
# The Command Line
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"

Shell is scripting in any CLI interface. Bash is scripting in a "Unix" shell. They are both are used interchangeably but they are different.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The "View A File (less, MORE)" exercise was the most challenging. The author was vague in his explanation so I had to come up with the solution. I followed what he was explaining, however I had issues physically cp'ing the .txt file into my shell.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

No, the part where I had to create .txt files and cp them. My terminal kept popping up that the file could not be located. That was quite infuriating considering I retraced my steps in the tutorial to make sure I was following what the author was explaining. I ended just using the GUI and dragging the file into the Terminal and got it to work for the follow exercises. But I wasn't able to cp correctly as told. I was spending way too much time on trying to do it correctly and decided I needed to move on.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I don't know. I feel I don't have enough experience yet to answer this question correctly. But, to answer answer the question, I would say grep or find. I believe at this stage it's going to be most important on how to located files and move them to the correct place in order to manipulate them.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd print working directory

ls list directory

mv move directory or file

cd change directory

../ change back to previous directory

touch make an empty file

mkdir make directory

less page through file

rmdir remove directory

rm remove file

help Powershell term, but it means apropos or man in Unix for help dialog within the shell
