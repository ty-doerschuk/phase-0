#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
First thing is to follow the instructions here...https://github.com/new
Make sure you name it [USERNAME].github.io, its public, you select to have a README, and you add the MIT license. This creates a remote repo on GitHub.

Now to the creating a repo on your local computer.

1. Find the URL on your website repo page on GitHub, and copy it. The page should be opened from you what you completed above ^
2. Open your Unix Application, Terminal for me.
3. Enter Commands as follows

- ls
- cd documents
- mkdir [username].github.io
- cd [username].github.io
- git clone [copied link from Github]

AND BANG! You cloned the remote repo to your local computer.

#### Describe what open source means.
Open source is the practice of sharing computer programs code and allowing people to customize the code.

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.
Open source code is not a free-for-all, there are certain control measures to protect users and distribution. There main effort of licensing is to save the hassle of freely releasing work and granting permissions on a case by case basis. There are licenses already created that explicitly stating rights of the creator and the user. Thus, clearing the air and developers can get to work.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any “aha” moments? What did  you struggle with?

Pushing and pulling my local repo to remote repo via git commands. The last lessen really threw me for a loop, and the practice I got in 1.6 module helped clear the fog I had in 1.5. My first aha moment is when I saw the pull request on Github from my local repo. That was pretty nice. But no aha moments in 1.6. Lesson 1.6 was such a relief compared to 1.5.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No, this lesson was pretty straight forward and easy to follow with the resources already provided.
