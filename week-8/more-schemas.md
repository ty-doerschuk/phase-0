My SQL would be for a database of bicycles. The first list would give the basics such as frame size, color, make, model, etc. In the retail bike world, when you say a bike is a ‘cruiser’, you assume it’s a low sitting wide handle bar bike made for recreation. However, when you get into a time trial or cyclocross bike, you assume what they look like, but you as the rider, you want to know specific things about the bike’s specific geometry. You would want to know the fork angle if you are a cyclocross rider because that bike will give you a faster top speed or better angling. So recalling bike geometry is a case by case basic when referring bike catalogs. If you were sorting your bikes, you would do it by frame size or make, not by BB drop. However, you would still want that information if available and needed.

What is a one-to-one database?
A one-to-one database is when two things have a single relationship to each other.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created). When sometimes you don’t want to access specific data, where sometimes the data is null or not relevant to what you are searching. One-to-one is way of keeping data bases clean.

What is a many-to-many database?
Many-to-many refers to a relationship between databases when a row in one table contains information from an additional related table. These two tables are joined on a separate table.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
You would want to use many-to-many database when you have associated data that goes further than just a single pair (like one-to-one). An example of this may be the rationship between employees and the departments.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
The overall theory makes sense, however it’s hard to follow by just reading. I think it will make more sense once we start practicing complex SQL code.
