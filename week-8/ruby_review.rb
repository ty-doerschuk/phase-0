# Cipher Challenge

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing.
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

            "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
# Hashes are probably the best for this because you want a key and a direct value because you need to diciper string code. I don't see how an array you be much help because it would be a list of values with no reference point.

    # Since nothing has been diciped yet, it has to be false because there is nothing ciphered. Not until there is a correct match should this change. If it's set to true, it assumes that everything is a correct cipher match.

# Reflection
# Keep your reflection limited to 10-15 minutes!


# What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?
# Iterating through an array and hash and a how to write a simple algorithm.

# What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
# Some of the naissances in control flow. There seems to always a little thing in control flow I didnâ€™t know was possible or not possible with each Ruby exercise.

# What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
# Control flow.
