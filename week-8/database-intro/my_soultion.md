What are databases for?
Databases store mass amounts of data information.

What is a one-to-many relationship?
It has to do with more than one table. This is where one row in a table can be related to many rows in a related table.

What is a primary key? What is a foreign key? How can you determine which is which?
Primary key uniquely identifies each record in a database table. A foreign key is when a table uses a column to list the primary key of a related table, thus primary key is linked to a second table.

How can you select information out of a SQL database? What are some general guidelines for that?
Through correct syntax with the major commands such SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE. You then input these into a SQL statements to access the data. Itâ€™s good to know all commands will be upper case and every SQL statement will end with a semi colon.
