#### How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome’s Dev tools show the current HTML and CSS in an editable non-save state. This is helpful when you want to see your actual HTML/CSS and make fluid changes on a browser.

#### How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can navigate through the HTML code to find the element you want to change, then navigate to the associated CSS and change the CSS mark-up.

#### What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute - positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
Fixed - positioned relative to the viewpoint, which means its anchored to a specific pixel on the screen.
Relative - positioned relative to its normal position.
Static - positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
Sizing has been so hard to learn for me and I have experience with it! haha… Fixed is easiest to use, but you’re sparingly going to use that on a webpage. Absolute is the hardest to work with because it’s dependent on other elements being relative.

#### What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin - the transparent area outside the border. Used mostly for positioning in my opinion.
Border - the area between the margin and padding.
Padding - Similar to the margin in that the padding is transparent. It’s the clear area around the physical content.

#### What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I would give it a 7/10 on difficulty. At first I thought it would take an hour, but I was wrong with that estimate. Some of the challenges took some serious time. However, you have to put in the hard work (like this challenge) if you want to learn CSS. Good challenge.
