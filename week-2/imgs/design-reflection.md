#### What is your site’s primary goal or purpose?
Share personal information for fellow cohort students and potential employers.

#### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience will want to know my experiences and what I am currently working on. My site will be set up by contact info, my military experience, my entrepreneur experience, and my current DBC Blog/Projects.

#### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
See my portfolio and then my contact information.

#### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Design and user experience are co-dependent. Websites that are functional to the user are helped by useful designs that help the user navigate appropriately.

#### What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience, UX, is how a user feels when interfacing with a system. UX is valuable because deals with user’s needs and requirements.

#### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The last bullet in Release 3 markdown step is unclear. The “markdown” link made things very complicated. I don’t know if my png is supposed to show on sublime before I push it to the Github repo or I am supposed to see it after I push it on the Github remote repo.
