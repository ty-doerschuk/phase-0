   <!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Emily had little practical experience, so making an actual site involved more googling how elements are made. Tyler had some experience, but it's good to start from scratch and input HTML code.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Difficult, because it required precision in writing the name of the tag and knowing where to put it.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Poor, we were worried about getting content online.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Bad is that a higher-up error can throw an error in the code down the page. Good in that the precision leads to quality results when it actually works!
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always close tags that you open, try to think of it as a nested structure of information.
