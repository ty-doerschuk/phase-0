#### What is a wireframe?
A wireframe allow you to define the information hierarchy of your website, thus making it easier to navigate and disseminate data.
#### What are the benefits of wireframing?
You get to see a visual outline of your future website before you start coding HTML and CSS.
#### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
It was okay, I have some experience with Adobe Illustrator so I found the physical creation of the wireframes not too difficult. Thankfully my past experience with AI was helpful because the process of learning how the wireframe-creation app works will slow down the creation of the wireframe.
#### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with my first idea. Wireframes, like the module said are a rabbit hole. You’re going to have multiple drafts and come up with better ideas over time, so I don’t want to waste energy on creating a “perfect wireframe”. It’s going to change, regardless of how great your first draft is.
#### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
The mod was pretty straight forward. I used a free .ai template for wire framing. That was a great time saver. Thank heavens for the giving people on the internet.
#### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed working more with the process of using branches in the terminal. I find the capalitibes of the the CLI fascinating that I just want to keep practicing. I am competent enough working with Git commands for Phase 0, but I want to be perfect. The creating the physical wireframe was quite easy because I have experience with Illustrator and graphic design from my past small business.
